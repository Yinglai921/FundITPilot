The specific challenge consists in increasing the availability to end users, lowering the cost of end products by scaling-up efficient manufacturing and purification process (e.g. high expression yields, the recombinant product authenticity), shortening production cycles for necessary efficacy and achieving high product yield.

Establishing such new value chains requires bio-based (manufacturing) industries to seek a closer cooperation with market actors to understand the specific market demands, and with biomass feedstock producers and suppliers to ensure the long-term supply of the required sustainable feedstock for the desired bio-based materials.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Develop bio-based materials with new functionalities for food packaging.

Also, further research is required to mitigate the impact of environmental microbial flora that may negatively affect the bio-production in terms of yield and/or quality of the products.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Improve the techniques for microbial construction and control, leading to an intensification of microbial bio-catalysis for the converting biomass into bio-based chemicals and avoiding the use of chemical additives in the production cycle in order to limit the environmental impact of the process.

This should allow for a better and broader application of the innovative techniques, with the aim of replacing current microbial strains within the value chains based on bio-catalysis. In addition, proposals should prove high levels of safety and sustainability, from technical, economic and environmental points of view, required for a feasible scale-up towards demonstration levels.</p><p>The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5.

The top three among these challenges relate to the enormous growth of the market and subsequent investments and production in China; the production of chemicals and materials in the Middle East based on amply available oil and gas; and the \u2018shale gas revolution\u2019 in the USA providing the local industry a significant advantage in raw material and energy availability. As a result, the share of European chemical production has dropped around 50% in the last 20 years. In addition, major new investments in production capacity have been taking place in China and the USA, while chemicals from these areas are increasingly finding their way to the European market.</p><p>To meet these challenges, the chemical industry in Europe has stepped up its drive towards higher resources- (raw material and water) and energy-efficiency, and has focused on business and operational excellence towards sustainability. While safeguarding base chemicals production, the industry has started to utilise renewable raw materials, making \u2018drop-in\u2019 bio-based chemicals to replace fossil-based products where justified, and at the same time making new bio-based products with new functionalities for initial niche market applications.</p><p>During the past years, many successful production and subsequent use of bio-based building blocks have started up. However, their production and applications are limited. Aside from technical and operational challenges, there is a plethora of hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance hindering the chemical industry to increase its bio-based portfolio.</p><p>The challenge is to make a clear overview of the hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance, set up a plan for their removal and agree on a roadmap for the chemical industry to increase production of bio-based building blocks for market applications that meet societal needs.

One significant result hereof is that intermediate \u2018by-product\u2019, \u2018waste\u2019 and 'residue' streams from separate value chains can be utilised as feedstock in other value chains through biorefining. This will imply an integrated biorefinery approach and establish a circular bioeconomy.</p><p>In addition, actors in bio-based industries have developed new schemes for cascading exploitation of biomass in order to maximise the efficient use of resources and the value of products.

This will help secure European arable land productivity while also boosting sustainability and resource efficiency of the farming practices. For many years,</p><p>mineral fertilisers have been used to intensify crop production to meet the food demand of a growing population. Mineral fertilisers represent 80 % of the market value of all fertilisers in the EU: they are manufactured from feedstock (such as phosphate rocks) imported from third countries or are based on energy-intensive production processes (for example nitrogen fertilisers), all of which are non-renewable resources.</p><p>At the time of drafting this Annual Work Plan, a new EU regulation on fertilising products<sup>1</sup> was under discussion among the co-legislators with a view to setting common rules for CE-marked fertilising products and level the playing field between mineral and organic fertilising products. This regulation will offer an access to the single market to innovative fertilising products such as those derived from secondary raw materials, whereas they were until now limited to national markets. The legislative proposal also imposes safety requirements to all fertilising products and requires, for instance, coating materials used in certain controlled-release fertilisers to be bio-degradable.</p><p>The loss of nutrients with traditional fertilisers has indeed been combated by the introduction of Controlled-Release Fertilisers (CRFs), which can better match the plants\u2019 need for the nutrients over time. However, the use of these CRFs involves the use of plastic polymers, which are not biodegradable and lead to an accumulation of plastic impurities in soil. The new EU regulation on fertilising products addresses the degradability of the coatings of CRFs by stipulating a 90 % conversion of the organic carbon into CO<sub>2</sub> in maximum 24 months.</p><p>The specific challenge is therefore to concentrate on finding coating polymers that are compliant with the biodegradability parameter in compliance with law, while achieving the controlled release of nutrients in the best possible manner.</p><p>Improving the nutrient quality of soils can also be achieved by the application of plant biostimulants, including microorganisms. This could be done by either stimulating plant capacities to absorb nutrients present in the environment, including in air or in soils, by stimulating soil microbiota (known as the \u2018prebiotic approach\u2019), or by introducing microorganisms into soil to transform <em>in situ</em> the non-available nutrients present into forms that plants can absorb (known as the \u2018probiotic approach\u2019). However, these concepts need to be demonstrated in an industrially relevant environment for an efficient and expanded use throughout Europe.</p><p>Another specific challenge is to demonstrate the use of advanced bio-based fertilising products that meet EU rules and that increase the sustainability of fertilising practices and the productivity of the agriculture in Europe. These could be fertilisers from bio-based streams, fully biodegradable coatings for CRFs or the smart use of plant biostimulants, including microorganisms.</p><p><em><sup>1 </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-157-EN-F1-1.PDF\">https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-157-EN-F1-1.PDF</a></em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Demonstrate the following three uses in value chains to improve the sustainability of fertilising products and practices in agriculture:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>component materials in more sustainable fertilising products from local bio-based waste streams and co-products that fully comply with the proposed revised EU rules mentioned above and that can help to replace less sustainable fertilisers, including those currently imported;</li>  <li>efficient bio-based biodegradable coatings for CRFs that can meet the proposed regulatory requirements on biodegradability of coatings in soils;</li>  <li>prebiotic and/or probiotic solutions for tailored soil nutrient improvement.</li> </ul><p>The consortium should be prepared to adapt its tasks (via an amendment to the Grant Agreement) to the final requirements laid down in the EU fertiliser regulation after its adoption, if applicable.</p><p>The new bio-based fertilising products should ensure and maintain the sustainability of the soil-plant system, be environmentally friendly and without adverse public health issues, and meet current and proposed regulations and standards.</p><p>Proposals should provide data showing evidence of the sustainable availability of the feedstock sources (for example agricultural and agro-industrial waste, animal by-products, by-products of the agro-food industry or sewage sludges), also in view of a further scale-up of the technologies and processes developed.</p><p>Proposals should specifically demonstrate the benefits versus the state-of-the-art and existing technologies.

It is present in resources such as woody crops, agricultural and forest residues, residues from agro-industrial processing and forest-based industries, as well as residues from conventional biomass conversion plants. While bio-based chemicals, materials and ethanol produced from food crops are already on the market, meeting market standards for a wide variety of applications, their production from lignocellulosic feedstock opens up large opportunities in terms of enhancing sustainability, avoiding land conflicts and expanding resource potential. Demonstration activities are already being pursued to exploit this vast renewable resource through the application of biotechnological, chemical or other processes. However, the challenge lies in establishing at industrial scale a first-of-a-kind, cost-effective biorefinery concept leading to the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into bio-based chemicals, materials and ethanol.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of transformation of one or multiple lignocellulosic feedstock into one of the following bio-based products/applications:</p><p>i) bioethanol targeting a production capacity of at least 50,000 ton/year. Proposals should address the valorisation of co-products and show a credible path towards becoming an integrated biorefinery concept by applying a cascading approach.</p><p>ii) diols and/or diacids as bio-based chemical building blocks targeting a production capacity of at least 5000 ton/year. Proposals should address their further conversion into sustainable biomaterials within an integrated biorefinery concept applying a cascading approach.</p><p>Proposals should pursue all possible means of industrial symbiosis and integration of actors along the whole value chain and, wherever possible, make use of existing facilities. Proposals should prove the sustainable and economical access to sufficient raw material to set up the whole value chain, and include activities to ensure the functioning/organisation of a sustainable supply chain. Proposals will assess market demand of the targeted products and will consider market-pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers\u2019 perception) aimed at facilitating their market uptake. Proposals should include a Life Cycle Analysis in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed products. Proposals are expected to verify and validate safety, quality and purity of end products to meet commercial requirements. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.</p><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

        "desc": "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Challenge</SPAN>:<p>Cellulose is a well-known and widely exploited material. Besides its traditional uses, recent technological developments are opening up the opportunity for the use of cellulose in new and higher added value applications. This does not only enhance the competitiveness of the concerned industrial sectors but also significantly improves their environmental performance. While demonstration activities are being pursued to this end, the challenge lies in demonstrating at industrial scale first-of-a-kind cost-effective biorefinery concepts leading to the production of economically competitive cellulose-based products for bulk materials and volume applications.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of biorefinery concepts leading to new cellulose-based products with tailored functionalities into either of the following applications:</p><p>i) Microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) based additives providing enhanced properties such as control of rheology, barrier and strength properties for stabilizers of emulsions and dispersions, biodegradable viscosifiers, barrier and strength enhancers, industrial thickeners in glues, paint, pastes and slurries and many more new applications. Proposals should realise an industrial scale process to produce MFC in suitable quantities, for at least 1000 ton/y of MFC-based products with an optimised efficiency in terms of performance, throughput and energy requirements so as to allow a suitable price for a significant industrial production;</p><p>ii) Lightweight structural composites based on (bio-based and/or conventional) polymers reinforced with cellulose pulp fibres. Proposals should address the technological challenge represented by the different polarities and viscosities between the cellulose and the matrix. Proposals should realise an industrial scale process of at least 25000 ton/year of composite materials, which can be converted with established processes used in volume applications, especially injection moulding. Application of the developed composites should be demonstrated up to the end products in markets such as structural elements for the automotive and building industry, cases for electronics products or household appliances.</p><p>Proposals should pursue all possible means of industrial symbiosis and integration of actors along the whole value chain and, wherever possible, make use of existing facilities. Proposals should address the industrial integration of the developed concepts into a cascading use of forest biomass. Proposals should include testing of the products at relevant scale in potential applications, and prove that the bio-based alternatives match functional and price requirements from the industry. Proposals should prove the economical access to sufficient raw material to set up the new value chain, and elaborate on the actions taken to ensure the functioning/organisation of the supply chain. Proposal will assess market demand of the targeted products and will consider market-pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers\u2019 perception) aimed at facilitating their market uptake. A Life Cycle Analysis should be included in order to demonstrate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed products. Safety and quality of end products must be verified in order to meet commercial requirements. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.</p><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Opening up significant potential for job creation in rural areas. Creating green jobs and facilitating the development of entrepreneurial activities throughout the entire value chain, with advantages for the primary sector (i.e. forest), the secondary sector (e.g. logistics, bioproduct transformation industry) and the tertiary sector;</li>   <li>Proposals dealing with microfibrillar cellulose will demonstrate MFC-based products with validated potential for exploitation in at least 10 applications in 5 market segments (food and/or industrial applications). MFC-based demonstrated products will match or outperform properties of competing conventional products (e.g. synthetic polymers like acrylics, gums, hydrocolloids, thickeners and high molecular weight polymer stabilizers), and show a CO<sub>2</sub> footprint 25% lower than competing technologies.</li>   <li>Proposals dealing with structural composites will demonstrate products that replace pure fossil based materials and compete with pure polymer solutions or mineral filled or short-fibre-glass reinforced composites in terms of mechanical properties, while exhibiting a significantly lower weight, reaching at least 25% weight reduction and a 100 times reduced tool wear compared to existing materials. Composite materials will be converted into at least 20 applications, thus increasing the competitiveness of leading European industries such as the automotive or chemical industry, along the value chain.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/kets.html#c,topics=flags/s/X-KET/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Cross-cutting Key-Enabling Technologies (KETs)</a><br></p>\n"

A variety of obstacles have to be faced in current operations, and improved performances and reaction capabilities are required. Tactical communications between surface and aerial assets are considered key for improving situational awareness, early warning and reaction capacity. A particular weakness lies in communications capabilities among the mobile assets and the control centres (in particular in relation to tactical communications, interoperability and standardization). Better surveillance platforms are necessary, with improved communication performance, improved endurance (it should be more than 10 hours), and reduced operational cost (10 to 20 per cent of that of a Maritime Patrol Aircraft).</p><p><u>Scope:</u> </p><p>The proposed action must be structured along the following phases:</p><p><u>Phase 0:</u> The participating users/buyers of R&D service should agree on common performance levels and associated specifications for the detection, early identification, and tracking of moving targets, as well as on communication specifications, standards and interfaces for information exchanges between platforms (be them surface or airborne). Interoperability to existing systems should be analysed.</p><p><u>Phase 1:</u> They will plan the research and the design of solutions covering a broad variety of issues, including technologies for:</p><ul>  <li>surveillance (e.g. lower weight/higher performance radar and electro-optic/systems and hyper-spectral sensors);</li>  <li>detection and early identification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. with moving target indication and data fusion/correlation capabilities), including the detection of marine pollution incidents;</li>  <li>response (e.g. techniques for the analysis of identification of anomalous behaviour and generation of alarm with the appropriate confidence level, methods for improved mission planning, obstacle detection and avoidance);</li>  <li>higher efficiency/lower emissions/low operational costs naval architecture and platforms (crafts, small boats);</li>  <li>air-to-surface tactical communication and cooperation between naval and aerial platforms.</li> </ul><p>Aerial platforms should carry at least a Maritime Surveillance payload consisting of: Light maritime radar, Electro-Optical camera (Visible and IR), AIS receiver, SATCOM for beyond line of sight operation. The platform should be fitted with mission support software providing data fusion capability and close to real time transmission to ground control station of mission data.</p><p>The results of phase 1 should lead to calls for tenders (for the procurement of R&D services) which focus on technologies clearly identified to be part of a unique architecture.</p><p><u>Phase 2:</u> The research and specification work should lead to at least 3 prototypes, each consisting of a system including communicating airborne and seaborne equipped platform(s). Prototyping should contribute to standardisation, including of naval construction. The aerial platform(s) should be certified for flying with a pilot on board, with mission payload being controlled from a ground station, and the platform should be tested to fly in remote piloted mode. The work during this phase should be procured in the light of the development of European regulations as regards to RPAS for improved surveillance, possibly flying in non-segregated air spaces.</p><p><u>Phase 3:</u> By 2020, the project should have designed, documented, and set up at least one operational scenario in which all the prototypes and elements of systems issued from the previous phase of the action (possibly combined with pre-existing capabilities) will be tested. This scenario should take place within an actual multinational operation, such as a FRONTEX-coordinated joint operation. The participation of competent border authorities should therefore be a prerequisite for the implementation of this action.</p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> </p><p>Impact will depend on the potential to develop and validate future solutions by means of the experimentation with innovative proposals in a real operational environment. This can be achieved if procurement actions are tailored to the requirements defined by the users/buyers of the R&D services, and also take due account of industrial capacities to ensure future supply.</p><p>The work undertaken under this topic is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the prototype systems as compared to more conventional border surveillance systems, and the systems used for the detection of marine pollution incidents. It would contribute further to the development of the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) at sea initiative. By enhancing joint communications capabilities, as well as the mobility, projection and sustainability of a common pan-European pool of maritime border patrol equipment, it will also contribute to the concept of Common Application of Surveillance Tools, as included in the final steps of the European Border Surveillance System<sup>1</sup> (EUROSUR).</p><p>For the impact of the action to be above threshold the proposal must necessarily state:</p><ol>  <li>the participants' agreement to negotiate in good faith and on a case by case basis, licenses to any and all of their to the background necessary for the implementation and use of the contents of the standards, specifications, design, research roadmaps, tender packages or other documents generated in the action.</li>  <li>the participants' commitment that all such licenses shall be according to Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (\u201cFRAND\u201d) terms.\u201d</li> </ol><p><u>Type of action:</u> Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) co-fund action</p><p>Further to the PCP\u2019s successful achievement, the European Commission may consider launching a PPI to facilitate the acquisition of operational systems satisfying the specifications established within the PCP, possibly in synergy with the Internal Security Fund.</p><p><u>Indicative budget:</u> The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between \u20ac5m and \u20ac12m would allow for this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Timeframe:</u> The action is expected to have performed the testing of prototypes in the context of operational scenarios by 2020.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[1] The aim of EUROSUR is to reinforce the control of the Schengen external borders. EUROSUR will establish a mechanism for Member States'authorities carrying out border surveillance activities to share operational information with a view to reduce the loss of lives at sea and the number of irregular immigrants entering the EU undetected, and\u00a0 increase internal security by preventing cross-border crime such trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of weapons and drugs. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/innov_proc.html#c,topics=flags/s/InnovationProcurement/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Innovation Procurement</a><br></p>\n"

These items may be narcotics, explosives, currency and weapons and could also be ampoules containing chemical and biological threats. All these items could remain undetected by conventional technologies.</p><p>There is a need to develop body-scan technology able to discern those commodities sought by Customs from benign materials carried by travellers. The device/system should have the capability to automatically identify the chemical composition of the main threat commodities. Such systems are expected to improve efficiency of inspection of suspected individuals, improve security at the border and act as a deterrent to other potential smugglers.</p><p><u>Scope: </u></p><p>There are two different scenarios that technology is required for. Although ideally a system would have a capability to be deployed to cover both operational situations, it is accepted that at this stage it may not be possible, due to the types of core technology used, so within this topic the requirements are shown separately to clarify the challenge, and so assist development in proposals which may be for either a sub category or for a combined solution.</p><p>1) Internally concealed commodities</p><p>Packages may be ingested, or inserted into body orifices. Ingested packages may be formed of compressed powder, or even liquid and may weight from a few hundred grams up to over a kilo. Non-ingested items may be several hundred grams. Drugs, used in the example, are by nature organic, so it is difficult to distinguish them visually from other organic or food waste in the digestive system of the human body. Transmission x-ray is a useful tool, but it is an imaging technology which requires interpretation. There is a potential for error and packages may be missed. </p><p>There is a requirement to develop a body-scanner capable of identifying and alerting an operator to specific threats (such as narcotics /explosives etc.) concealed inside the body. If the technology in the proposal were to utilise ionising radiation, it would have to comply with European limits of dose and comply with any justification process for the use of radiation, , which might be in force with the countries of intended operation. It should also be noted that not all Member States and Associated Countries permit use of ionising radiation for non-medical purposes</p><p>2) Externally concealed commodities.</p><p>Packages such as drugs can be concealed beneath clothing and even be moulded to map the body contours, which can be compensated for by the wearing or larger clothing. A human can conceal up to 5 kilos in this manner, which can be remain undetected. Organic materials which have been on the body for a significant duration can become opaque to some technologies, that operate in the thermal-sensitive domain, if they are close to the body temperature. The ideal novel solutions must be able to distinguish those materials of Customs or Police/Security interest from harmless items and alert the operator. This solution would typically be applied to a \u201cnon-divest\u201d situation. It must be able to work in real-time, not to disrupt passenger flow or movement of a crowd. Preferably the solution should be able to deal with more than one person within the field of view, or at least other people in the frame should not interfere with the performance of the primary target. Performance will have to be validated in a realistic scenario. Proposals dealing with the concurrent screening of bags and other carried possessions would be of interest.</p><p>The technology should pose no risk to particular groups, or those with health issues (children, pregnant woman, pacemakers). The privacy of individuals must be respected.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between \u20ac2m and \u20ac5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation<sup>[1]</sup> international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities.

Thus far the technology of choice is X-ray interrogation (supported by risk-selection). Ideally, upon effective risk selection, the most effective (array of) technology out of a number of availabilities should be selected to screen the freight.

Solutions are therefore to be developed to allow for an increased assurance level in particular for dense containerised cargo, avoiding the need to unnecessarily resorting to physical inspection. As the research should facilitate and expedite the smooth flow of legitimate international trade through improved security controls, it would support the work of WCO for high risk cargo.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Research & Innovation Actions</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[1] COM(2012)497</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/international_cooperation.html#c,topics=flags/s/IntlCoop/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n"

Furthermore, a decade long international investment in instrumenting and quantifying the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation provides a robust foundation upon which large process studies can be built to study the biogeochemistry and biodiversity that controls growth at the base of the ocean food web. Such studies can inform a mechanistic understanding of element and energy flow in the system, which are important to modeling, predicting future changes in such things as ocean atmosphere feedback loops and sustainable yields for fisheries. The exploitation of aquatic living resources in the North Atlantic has been a key driver for growth and wealth creation in several coastal areas. However, the biodiversity and functioning of this fragile environment as well as the products and services they provide are currently under threat. Addressing these pressures cost-effectively, requires a strengthened knowledge base, improved innovation and predictive capacity and the development of adaptive management plans for sustainable exploitation and use of the marine resources.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> Proposals should fill in knowledge gaps to deepen the understanding of the biogeographic patterns, biodiversity, biogeochemistry and ecosystem services and goods supported by different marine ecosystems at ocean basin and management relevant scales and the capacity to model, understand and predict shifts in the dynamics of North Atlantic ecosystems, thereby supporting preservation and unlocking the potential for the sustainable production of new products and industrial applications. Decision support tools and methodologies should be developed to support adaptive (ecosystem based) management approaches enabling good governance of the North Atlantic marine ecosystem by the bordering countries so as to secure the sustainable exploitation of the living resources whilst ensuring its preservation. The work may draw upon related research expertise that has been developed within other sea basins. Proposals should also develop genuinely cross-disciplinary, integrated, systemic approaches \u2013 including the socio-economic dimension, as well as the engagement of the broader stakeholder communities.

In the context of an increasing global population and demand for sufficient and safe food supplies, it is critical to predict and anticipate the nature and magnitude of potential impacts of climate change on food production systems. A lot of scientific effort is put on the understanding of the interrelations between the oceans and the climate system, which is also a key prerequisite for predicting and anticipating potential consequences of climate change on seafood production methods and systems. Ensuring sufficient preparedness and quick adaptation capacity of European marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture sectors to potential threats and opportunities due to climate change might be decisive for the long term sustainability of the two sectors, as well as for guaranteeing to European consumers and societies an acceptable degree of self-sufficiency of seafood supplies.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> Proposals should give similar emphasis on both (A) and (B):</p><p>A. Proposals should focus on understanding how climate change may affect the most important and less resilient exploited European fish stocks and should cover the diversity of ecosystems and EU fisheries. They should provide new insights, at different geographic scales (in the major European oceans, seas and inland waters) and different climate change scenarios, on how climate-induced changes may affect important biological processes (including, reproductive success, population dynamics, migration patterns, interactions between fish populations, etc.). Particular focus should be given on risk assessment and management, elaboration of adaptation strategies for fisheries management and development of novel forecasting and early warning methodologies.</p><p>B.\u00a0 Proposals should also investigate the potential effects and consequences of climate change on aquaculture taking into account the diversity of aquaculture practices, species and regional specificities, farming technologies and specific requirements of established and emerging European farmed species. Proposals should identify and model potential threats from global warming (including sea level rise, temperature/salinity changes, acidification, coastal erosion, HABs shellfish toxins, jellyfish, diseases spread and pathogens virulence, invasive species etc.) on the main segments of the European aquaculture sector (including freshwater), while considering the diversity of species and regional specificities of this sector. They should assess the economic risks related to these threats and should propose scenarios and realistic and cost-efficient adaptation and mitigation options and tools. </p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

However, it remains fragmented, poorly understood and underexploited. As coastal populations grow worldwide, not only due to permanent dwellers but also due to increasingly larger number of tourists, the determinants and impacts of this link between oceans and people become more relevant. On the one hand, the seas provide benefits namely through food, feed and positive impacts on overall wellness. On the other hand, the risks associated with the marine environment include chemical and physical pollutants of anthropogenic origin, harmful algal blooms, and countless marine microorganisms that lead to a still poorly assessed proportion of human morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the challenge is to coordinate the existing multidisciplinary research knowledge and resources, including distributed infrastructures, across Europe. This would make it easier to take advantage of the benefits and to better manage the risks of the interaction between oceans and people using an ecosystem-based approach and to formulate evidence-based policies that can benefit citizens as well as achieving good environmental status.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should include a plan for the creation of a multi-stakeholder forum that would make it possible to better understand the potential health benefits of marine and coastal ecosystems including in economic terms, anticipate new threats to public health more effectively, identify ways of improving ecosystem services that the marine environment can provide and contribute to reducing the burden of diseases caused by the interplay between marine-degraded environments and human behaviour. This forum is expected to issue a strategic research agenda based on data covering the biological, cultural and socio-economic dimensions of the interaction between oceans and human health that can ultimately impact morbidity and mortality in the general population.

The Atlantic Ocean is the most prominent maritime domain situated at the doorstep of Europe. However, the sustainable exploration, exploitation and protection of this maritime domain require a knowledge base and predictive capabilities which are currently fragmented or not yet available. The creation of this knowledge base and predictive capability requires systematic collection of ocean observations recorded both remotely using Earth observation satellites and in-situ. Central to the development of the IAOOS should be the acquisition and use of in-situ observations and their integration with remote sensed data across the whole Atlantic Ocean in order to fill out the existing observational gaps.

Climate change is significantly affecting the extent and thickness of sea-ice, on snow cover on ice-sheet melting, on permafrost thawing, and on marine and land ecosystems. These changes are bringing with them both risks and opportunities, and an integrated and multi-disciplinary Arctic observation system is becoming essential for studying, forecasting and assessing changes that support the region's sustainable development. Improving and coordinating current capabilities for assessing and predicting Arctic environmental change requires the provision of data on a number of key variables of Arctic meteorology, climatology, oceanography, ecosystems and pollution at various scales. Monitoring and improved understanding of the Arctic climate system and its teleconnections, as well as of ecosystem change and the socio-economic impacts on offshore operations, new shipping routes, mining activities, tourism etc. are important prerequisites for effectively assessing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the Arctic and elsewhere.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>An integrated Arctic observation system should close critical gaps with innovative solutions, as well as improve the integration and inter-operability of existing observation systems, also in view of data assimilation into models. The activity shall be based on co-operation between the existing European and international infrastructures (in-situ and remote including space-based) and the modelling communities, with the active participation of relevant stakeholder groups. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), the action should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance, the Sustaining Arctic Observation Networks (SAON) and the Cold Region Initiative of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). It should have links to the relevant Copernicus and European Space Agency (ESA) programmes and infrastructure in order to maximise the synergies other European efforts to develop an integrated Arctic observation system. In particular, strong coordination with the on-going Horizon 2020 project which aims to develop an Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observation System <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> should be sought and with the relevant ESFRI research infrastructures. The activity shall support and promote the integrated use of Arctic land, ocean, ice and atmosphere<em> in-situ </em>and space-based observations from Europe, the USA, Canada and other international partners. Community-based observation programmes that draw on indigenous and local knowledge should be included and should form the basis for participatory research and capacity-building within Arctic communities. The action should ensure data interoperability through internationally recognised standardisation and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) processes, promote database integration and allow free and open access to all data and data products, following the GEO data sharing principles. It should make best use of reference sites (supersites) and should contribute to filling <em>in-situ </em>observational gaps through novel technology development, with particular attention to the gaps that may help improve the accuracy of predictive models.

Thawing of permafrost may trigger the release of this carbon and its transformation to greenhouse gases, reinforcing global warming (permafrost carbon feedback). Moreover, permafrost coasts make up 34% of the world's coasts. Increasing sea-level in combination with changing sea-ice cover and permafrost thawing expose these coastal areas to higher risks. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the transfer of material - including organic matter - from land to sea and its fate, with the consequence that processes of accumulation and/or subsea permafrost degradation are not accounted for in global climate and Earth system models. The pressing challenge is to understand the impact of permafrost thawing on climate change and its implications for the environment, for the indigenous populations and the local communities. Finally, permafrost thawing affects the stability of built infrastructure.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Actions should assess the impact of permafrost thawing on Arctic (natural and human) coastal systems and its effect on the availability/accessibility of resources, the stability of infrastructure, the growth of potential new economic activities, as well as on pollution and health. The research should employ a holistic and trans-disciplinary approach and in co-operation with stakeholders. It should consider the needs of and the impacts on indigenous populations, local communities and economic actors operating in this vulnerable region in the sustainable development context. Actions should address key processes of environmental change and develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation responses with an emphasis on permafrost at the interface between land and water.</p><p>Proposals should develop relevant forms of communication for EU (and possible national) services to adequately disseminate results that could be used for policy action. Trans-disciplinary and participatory approaches, including social sciences and humanities, in the process are considered necessary. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>, actions will contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance. Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the USA and from Canada<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. International cooperation with partners from other Arctic and non-Arctic third countries is also strongly encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Improve the capacity to predict the impacts of permafrost thawing, both sub-sea and on land, identify and reduce uncertainties, and quantify key processes not currently or poorly represented in predictive models;</li>  <li>Develop capacity to manage risks and to take advantage of opportunities emerging from Arctic changes;</li>  <li>Promote the engagement of and interaction with residents of Arctic coastal communities and indigenous societies and develop a legacy of collaborative community involvement with scientific, economic, and societal actors and stakeholders on the development of Responsible Research and Innovation agendas that meet their concerns and expectations;</li>  <li>Contribute to the ongoing and possible future OSPAR actions in Arctic water;</li>  <li>Improve the professional skills and competences for those working and being trained to work within this subject area;</li>  <li>Contribute to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/open_science.html#c,topics=flags/s/OpenScience/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Open Science</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/international_cooperation.html#c,topics=flags/s/IntlCoop/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">International cooperation</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/ssh.html#c,topics=flags/s/SSH/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>(COM(2012)497)</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>Please note that participants from developed countries are not eligible for Horizon 2020 funding.</p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>Beneficiaries of projects participating in the pilot on open research data should follow the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Data Sharing Principles and register in GEOSS the geospatial data, metadata and information generated as part of the project.

This must take into consideration the proper functioning of vulnerable marine ecosystems and sea-related economic sectors. In the Mediterranean region, several issues are specifically acute such as the vulnerability and poor resilience of ecosystems, the over-exploitation of seabed and biological resources, the severe pollution events and limited remediation actions, the drastic climate change effects, the frequent extreme events and geohazards, and the uneven protection of coastal infrastructures and populations. The EU is committed to supporting the development of solutions to solve the above mentioned issues through several policies and international agreements such as the EU Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the EU neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona convention and more recently the EU BLUEMED Initiative<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>. One of the main goals of the latter is to create an interoperable, fully integrated multiplatform observing and forecasting capacity to support the conservation of biodiversity, and to forecast and manage risks and emergencies at the coast and at sea. The implementation of these policies and conventions requires a strong knowledge base and predictive capacities that are derived from Earth observation data. These observation data are, however, still very fragmented, or are even lacking for certain areas of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular in the southern part. They are also still difficult to access, partly because of the many initiatives and systems that exist. The challenge here is to conduct the research and innovation activities that are necessary for the integration of the existing Earth observation facilities and networks in the Mediterranean Sea building on relevant initiatives such as Copernicus<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, GEOSS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, GOOS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, EMODNet<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, ESFRI<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> and in particular all those with strong links to marine and maritime issues, and national initiatives. This would fill out the existing observational gaps, and would help exploit the relevant data to build the necessary knowledge base and prediction capacities.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The research and innovation activities to be included in the proposal should contribute to the development of an integrated observing system for the whole Mediterranean Sea building on existing facilities (remote sensing and<em> in-situ</em>) and initiatives, and addressing both the open sea and the coastal zone. This should be based on open data and should facilitate easy access to those facilities and the data. Another focus should be on conducting the research and innovation necessary to underpin the full and open discovery and access to the ocean observations and to facilitate the interoperable exchange of ocean observation as promoted through the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) for the Mediterranean Sea. The proposal should also address observational gaps in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular those related to the <em>in-situ</em> component of the observation system. Optimising existing systems and using new ocean observation technologies make <em>in-situ</em> ocean observation and the integration of the biological dimension into observing systems more cost-effective. The proposals should also focus on the use of <em>in-situ</em> measurements to calibrate and validate relevant remote sensing data and products, including possible new products derived from space infrastructures such as the Sentinel and Earth Explorer missions that support the improvement and evolution of operational services in the Mediterranean Sea. The above activities should include the participation of international partners from the coastal states of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Increasing maritime traffic also leads to safety concerns, potential pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species. Fishing remains unsustainable. The area's marine heritage and its ecosystem services are also at risk. In addition, the geo-political complexity of the area adds further difficulties related to the establishment of favourable framework conditions to support the growth of a blue economy (e.g. in trans-border cooperation on sea-related activities, including maritime spatial planning).

Furthermore the Galway Statement and the recently endorsed Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> provides a unique framework for stimulating strategic cooperation between education, research, technology and industrial communities in order to jointly address challenges related to the sustainable exploitation of the Atlantic resources and thus promote economic growth and jobs for citizens and societies of both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>However, further efforts are needed to create appropriate operational conditions among the relevant marine research and innovation activities and programmes related to the Atlantic ocean with a view to enhance their effectiveness and impact and facilitate synergies and allow for new collaboration initiatives.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation in May 2013, and should benefit from the inclusion of partners from the US and Canada[2]. Proposals should underpin the establishment and implementation of the Atlantic Ocean Cooperation between the EU, its Member States and partner countries joining transatlantic research alliance as well as building on existing initiatives and programmes to increase coherence and coordination of ocean research cooperation programmes.</p><p>Proposals should address the following priority areas in an integrated way, identified in the Galway Statement:</p><p>(i) Marine ecosystem-approach, (ii) Observing systems, (ii) Marine biotechnology , (iii) Aquaculture (iv) Ocean literacy \u2013 engaging with society, (v) seabed and benthic habitat mapping.</p><p>Within these priority areas, proposals should facilitate the mapping and connectivity of relevant on-going research activities and programmes in the Atlantic and the identification of research gaps. Proposals should also consider ongoing work to create a European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). Proposals should contribute to aligning the planning and programming of research activities, in view of launching joint Research & Innovation initiatives, while building on existing ones (e.g. Joint programming Initiative \"Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans\", marine ERA-NETs (e.g. Seas-Era) and also national and multilateral initiatives). Proposals should facilitate a shared use of infrastructures, as well as dissemination and knowledge transfer activities leading to an optimal exploitation of projects results, fostering mobility and networking of researchers. </p><p>Proposals should also establish a long-term knowledge sharing platform (existing knowledge or to be generated), in the areas mentioned above, to allow for long-term usability of the data, information and knowledge thereby ensuring tangible value creation from invested resources. This platform should comprise a classification system, which allows for an easy, focused, quick and reliable use and analysis of the information collected and stored. The principle of open access would need to govern such a platform. To enhance the exploitability of the platform for policy making and stakeholder consultation purposes, representatives from funding agencies and these communities should be consulted in their design. Options to secure the long-term viability of this platform should be included in the proposal. Cooperation is as well encouraged with partners established in other third countries (e.g. Brazil)[3].</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact: </u></p><ul>  <li>Support the implementation of the Galway Statement on an Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance.</li>  <li>Improve the international cooperation framework of marine research programmes thus creating the basis for the development of future large-scale joint international marine research programmes.</li>  <li>Establish a long term knowledge sharing platform for easy access to available information and data holding significant commercial potential relevant to the EU Blue Growth Agenda</li> </ul><p><u>Type of action:</u> Coordination and support actions </p><p>[1] Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation Launching a Canada- European Union- United States of America\u00a0 Research Alliance (Galway, 24th of May 2013)</p><p>[2] This is without prejudice to the general rules on the funding of legal entities from third-countries, as set in part A of the annex to the work programme.</p><p>[3] This is without prejudice to the general rules on the funding of legal entities from third-countries, as set in part A of the annex to the work programme.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/international_cooperation.html#c,topics=flags/s/IntlCoop/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n"

Increased shipping for transport and tourism purposes, highly variable fish stocks, increased oil and gas exploration and mining are challenges and opportunities faced in polar regions that require sound scientific knowledge of vulnerabilities and risks in order to develop appropriate regulatory policies. In the 2012 Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council 'Developing a European Union Policy towards the Arctic Region', the Commission and the High Representative point out that the EU will 'support research and channel knowledge to address the challenges of environmental and climate changes in the Arctic'. Rapid environmental changes in the Arctic and parts of the Antarctic continent have global impacts both by accelerating global warming and in a geo-strategic and socio-economic dimension. European countries operate world class research infrastructures in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and are leading in many fields of polar research with regards to climate, ecosystems, life in extreme environments, pollution monitoring and other aspects. Making the most efficient use of these resources and the latest scientific developments, for addressing the abovementioned challenges requires a high degree of coordination within Europe and beyond.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> Proposals should coordinate polar research in Europe and develop a comprehensive European Polar Research Programme.

In the Biotechnology areas stakeholder roadmaps and scientific publications are often outpaced by rapid progress made in research. The cross-cutting nature of biotechnology also requires targeting the limited funds available in the most efficient way.

However, the research behind full development of CO<sub>2</sub> reuse technologies is in its early stages. Some of these technologies use CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics, thus increasing the industrial biotechnology potential for enhancing European economic competitiveness. In this way, tackling the CO<sub>2</sub> challenge includes interesting possibilities for encouraging innovation and sustainability.</p><p>An industrial biotechnology route for CO<sub>2</sub> re-use is fermentation, where CO<sub>2</sub> is fermented into a desired molecule using hydrogen as a source of energy. However, there are technical issues that need to be resolved, because the biochemical reactions involved are not yet self-supporting in terms of energy for the industrial scale conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into chemicals. Moreover, the final yield of the products is low and the process needs optimisation. Ultimately, the success of CO<sub>2</sub> reuse technologies will depend on developing processes which are less energy and material intensive than the processes they aim to replace and which can be scaled to an industrial level of production. In this context, an important consideration or advantage would be the ability of the microbes to process raw CO<sub>2</sub> (low concentrations, presence of impurities, etc.).

Important gains in resource efficiency can be made by replacing current linear economic models with circular models of production and consumption, which result, at the same time, in a substantial reduction of GHG emissions. While relying on industrial leadership, the success of circular economy models will depend on adopting a systemic approach to eco-innovation that encompasses value and supply chains in their entirety and engages all actors involved in such chains. A systemic approach entails foresight of the diverse impacts that transformative innovative solutions can have on the economy, environment and society at large. Side-effects of innovative practices can thus be addressed, e.g. change in energy policy due to a reduction of waste available for energy recovery. Bringing end-users closer to the design and production phases, and customising the production and delivery of goods and associated services can boost new consumption patterns that add greater value and reduce over-production, waste and other negative environmental impacts. The involvement of end-users in designing circular economic models that better respond to their needs can enable the development of value-added solutions and act as a driver for Europe's re-industrialisation.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals shall address <strong>one </strong>of the following issues:</p><p><strong>a) Design for circular value and supply chains (2016): </strong>Through large scale demonstration projects, organisations, including from process and manufacturing industries and SMEs, whether dealing with biotic and/or abiotic resources, are expected to test and showcase circular economy solutions based on re-design of value and supply chains, taking into account products, production processes, and/or systems, as well as involving final users. Such solutions should entail the environmentally sustainable recovery, recycling and/or re-use of resources and energy flows, including by cross-sectorial symbiosis, within the overall chain from resources to marketed products.</p><p>The proposals should enable entrepreneurs, industries and researchers to collectively implement the innovative solutions at an appropriate scale, which goes beyond a single production plant. They should develop new forms of organisation and governance within and across value and supply chain(s), considering where appropriate collaboration between public and private sectors. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.</p><p>Where relevant, projects are expected to contribute to the implementation of the SPIRE PPP Roadmap.</p><p>For the technological innovation components, TRL 5-7 are to be aimed for (as defined in the General Annexes of this Work Programme). The EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> could be used to verify the performance of innovative technologies at higher TRLs.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>b) Systemic services for the circular economy (2017):</strong> To demonstrate through large scale projects the economic and environmental feasibility of circular economic business models that underpin new services based on performance/functionality rather than ownership, and/or on mass customisation, including through supporting demand side measures. Proposals should adopt a systemic eco-innovative approach addressing all forms of innovation, combining technological, organisational, societal, cultural and behavioural innovation, and strengthening the participation of civil society. Such an approach can foster new forms of collaboration between end-users, producers and researchers. In particular proposals should consider ways of supporting co-creation by developing, experimenting and demonstrating new business models together with end-users, taking into consideration their needs, including gender dimension, thus enabling the development of value adding solutions. Business models that foster new services and consumption and production patterns will require support to end-users in the transition to the circular economy by raising awareness and knowledge sharing activities on circular economy models. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>For both</strong>: Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In the latter case, contacts could be established with the funds managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.</p><p>Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' a bottom-up approach to address regulatory bottlenecks to innovation is understood, that would take the form of voluntary agreements, with the European Commission and external stakeholders, with the aim of identifying and overcoming regulatory barriers and thus facilitating the market up-take of innovative solutions.</p><p>A life cycle thinking and assessment, in line with the recommendations and reference data from the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> when applicable, should be applied.</p>\n<SPAN

It needs to revolutionise the way public and private actors work together so as to address water-related challenges and seize on opportunities strengthening a demand-driven approach. A systemic approach, incorporating both the physical structure of the system and the rules governing the operation, performance and interactions of its components, could address those issues in an integrated manner. Such an approach should go beyond the pursuit of wastewater treatment and reduction of water use to inspire technological, organisational and social innovation through the whole value chain of water (i.e. water as a resource, as a productive input and as a waste stream), moving towards a circular economy approach.</p><p>More specifically, with an increasing global demand for food, feed and fibre, the demand for nutrients is growing. Although increasing food and biomass production necessitates a higher application of nutrients, current fertilisation practices use resources inefficiently. At the same time accumulation of nutrients is causing major environmental problems. The EU legislation is already aiming at regulating nutrient emissions to the environment but more can be done to encourage a transition to an efficient nutrient recovery and recycling. Water is the most used carrier of nutrients and, at the same time, an important resource itself. Water treatment management models and technologies have the potential to create new business opportunities for an extensive nutrient recovery and contribute to the circular economy. However, an extensive implementation of integrated nutrient recovery technologies and the use of the recovered nutrients at European level is still lacking and this is proposed to be addressed in the 2016 call for proposals<strong>.</strong></p><p>In addition, today's water services aim mainly to save water and to improve its quality. However, water becomes more and more a scarce resource as a result of urbanisation, increased competition between various uses, economic sectors and extreme weather events. To deal effectively with these pressures, there is a need for improving water systems by considering the whole water-use production chain and by identifying solutions that enhance both the economic and environmental performance of the system. These innovative solutions should be in line with the objectives of the circular economy, contributing to the challenges of a depletion of raw materials (e.g. through the recovery of resources from waste water) and climate change (reducing energy needs or producing energy) and should be demonstrated at large scale. This is proposed to be addressed in the 2017 call for proposals.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals shall address <strong>one </strong>of the following issues:</p><p><strong>a) Demonstrating the potential of efficient nutrient recovery from water (2016): </strong>The objective of this topic is to implement large scale demonstration projects to tap the potential of nutrient recovery and to encourage the use of these nutrients throughout Europe. Projects should cover the whole value chain from recovery of nutrients to their recycling. The demonstration may involve recovery technologies implemented in any water sector (i.e. industrial, agriculture, or municipal). Treatment schemes should be optimised to allow better recovery rates and material qualities adapted to users\u2019 needs and capacities. A life-cycle assessment approach should be used together with environmental and health risk assessment methodologies. New business models exploiting the benefits associated with nutrient recovery and recycling should also be implemented and tested. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Relevant legal, societal and market challenges affecting the recycling of recovered nutrients and their market uptake should be addressed. Involvement of social sciences and humanities disciplines is deemed necessary, for instance to address issues such as attitudes to and acceptance of recycled products. Prospective end-users need to be involved in the projects, informing them about the quality and safety requirements to be met by the products derived from nutrient recovery, thus ensuring the involvement of the demand side to increase market success. Proposals should include participation of industry partners from relevant sectors, and active participation of SMEs where relevant.</p><p>This topic supports the implementation of the EIP Water, addressing several priority areas such as water and wastewater treatment, including recovery of resources, and water reuse and recyling.</p><p>Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 million and EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>b) Towards the next generation of water systems and services \u2013 large scale demonstration projects (2017): </strong>The objective of this topic is to demonstrate innovative solutions at a large scale (i.e regions, cities and/or river basins), in line with EIP Water priorities and the objectives of the Water Framework Directive. Proposals should focus on developing the water services of the future, going beyond water supply sustainability addressing the different water value chains. They should integrate, for instance, the management of water resources and the provision of water services, expanding the re-use of treated waste water and the use of desalinated water (where appropriate), ensuring carbon neutral water services, and closing the water cycle by increasing the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, including the recovery of energy and the re-use of chemicals and nutrients.</p><p>Projects should build on experience already gained in areas where integration of various aspects of water management and other economic and social activities is already taking place at different levels, with replication potential in other areas of Europe or at wider scale, thus demonstrating a real added-value at EU level. Successful projects should engage all relevant stakeholders, especially user communities, at an early stage in the co-creation process, bringing together technology push and application pull. This is also necessary to show the potential of using systemic eco-innovative approaches in water, to overcome related barriers and bottlenecks and to create new opportunities for jobs and growth in various regions and river basins. Participation of industry partners from relevant sectors is considered essential and the active participation of SMEs is encouraged. The application of new business models and new value chains is encouraged. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Where relevant, integrated environmental impact assessments and risk assessment of potential harmful substances should be considered. Relevant socio-economic issues, in particular, regulatory/governance issues, social behaviour and acceptability should also be addressed, requiring the participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines such as political sciences, economics, governance and business studies. To enhance the systemic approach and the transformation of water services toward a more circular economy approach, digital technologies and ICT tools should be also considered. Activities aiming at facilitating the market uptake of innovative solutions, including standardisation, should also be addressed.</p><p>Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In these cases, contacts could be established with the funds' managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.</p><p>Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>For both (2016 and 2017)</strong>: Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' an innovative better regulation instrument is understood, in the form of voluntary agreements with external stakeholders to identify and overcome regulatory barriers to innovative solutions that would enable policy or legislative objectives to be better achieved.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Projects are expected to contribute to:</p><p><strong>a)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>decreasing the dependency on primary nutrient resources and increasing the supply security at European level;</li>  <li>reducing the adverse effects of nutrient emissions on the environment;</li>  <li>closing the water and nutrients cycles in the whole production and consumption value chain;</li>  <li>improving the quality of data on nutrient flows, thus providing important information for investments into the recycling of recovered nutrients;</li>  <li>creating new green jobs and industries around nutrient recovery and recycling, including exports;</li>  <li>creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;</li>  <li>improving the policy and market conditions in Europe and globally for large scale deployment of innovative solutions;</li>  <li>providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU.</li> </ul><p><strong>b)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>significant reduction of the current water and energy consumption at regional and/or river basin scale by closing the cycles of material, water and energy, using alternative water sources and supporting the transition towards smart water services;</li>  <li>interconnectivity between the water system and other economic and social sectors;</li>  <li>increased public involvement in water management;</li>  <li>increased citizen satisfaction with water services;</li>  <li>replication of new business models in other areas and replication of models for synergies between appropriate funding instruments at regional, national or European level;</li>  <li>closing of the infrastructure and investment gap in the water service sector;</li>  <li>creation of new markets in the short and medium term;</li>  <li>providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU;</li>  <li>implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns' and SDG 6 'Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Paris on 12 December 2015.</p>"

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>b) Towards the next generation of water systems and services \u2013 large scale demonstration projects (2017): </strong>The objective of this topic is to demonstrate innovative solutions at a large scale (i.e regions, cities and/or river basins), in line with EIP Water priorities and the objectives of the Water Framework Directive. Proposals should focus on developing the water services of the future, going beyond water supply sustainability addressing the different water value chains. They should integrate, for instance, the management of water resources and the provision of water services, expanding the re-use of treated waste water and the use of desalinated water (where appropriate), ensuring carbon neutral water services, and closing the water cycle by increasing the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, including the recovery of energy and the re-use of chemicals and nutrients.</p><p>Projects should build on experience already gained in areas where integration of various aspects of water management and other economic and social activities is already taking place at different levels, with replication potential in other areas of Europe or at wider scale, thus demonstrating a real added-value at EU level. Successful projects should engage all relevant stakeholders, especially user communities, at an early stage in the co-creation process, bringing together technology push and application pull. This is also necessary to show the potential of using systemic eco-innovative approaches in water, to overcome related barriers and bottlenecks and to create new opportunities for jobs and growth in various regions and river basins. Participation of industry partners from relevant sectors is considered essential and the active participation of SMEs is encouraged. The application of new business models and new value chains is encouraged. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Where relevant, integrated environmental impact assessments and risk assessment of potential harmful substances should be considered. Relevant socio-economic issues, in particular, regulatory/governance issues, social behaviour and acceptability should also be addressed, requiring the participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines such as political sciences, economics, governance and business studies. To enhance the systemic approach and the transformation of water services toward a more circular economy approach, digital technologies and ICT tools should be also considered. Activities aiming at facilitating the market uptake of innovative solutions, including standardisation, should also be addressed.</p><p>Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In these cases, contacts could be established with the funds' managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.</p><p>Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>For both (2016 and 2017)</strong>: Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' an innovative better regulation instrument is understood, in the form of voluntary agreements with external stakeholders to identify and overcome regulatory barriers to innovative solutions that would enable policy or legislative objectives to be better achieved.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Projects are expected to contribute to:</p><p><strong>a)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>decreasing the dependency on primary nutrient resources and increasing the supply security at European level;</li>  <li>reducing the adverse effects of nutrient emissions on the environment;</li>  <li>closing the water and nutrients cycles in the whole production and consumption value chain;</li>  <li>improving the quality of data on nutrient flows, thus providing important information for investments into the recycling of recovered nutrients;</li>  <li>creating new green jobs and industries around nutrient recovery and recycling, including exports;</li>  <li>creating new business opportunities for industry and SMEs in the EU, contributing to the exploitation of EU innovative solutions, and improving the competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market for eco-innovative solutions;</li>  <li>improving the policy and market conditions in Europe and globally for large scale deployment of innovative solutions;</li>  <li>providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU.</li> </ul><p><strong>b)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>significant reduction of the current water and energy consumption at regional and/or river basin scale by closing the cycles of material, water and energy, using alternative water sources and supporting the transition towards smart water services;</li>  <li>interconnectivity between the water system and other economic and social sectors;</li>  <li>increased public involvement in water management;</li>  <li>increased citizen satisfaction with water services;</li>  <li>replication of new business models in other areas and replication of models for synergies between appropriate funding instruments at regional, national or European level;</li>  <li>closing of the infrastructure and investment gap in the water service sector;</li>  <li>creation of new markets in the short and medium term;</li>  <li>providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU;</li>  <li>implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 12 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns' and SDG 6 'Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Paris on 12 December 2015.</p>"

To capitalise on this potential, appropriate business models are required that can respond to the specific characteristics of the circular economy, in particular in terms of altering value chains, consumption patterns, producer-consumer relationships and financing needs. Furthermore, these business models need to address the issues of trust and traceability. This includes ensuring environmentally, economically and ethically secure sources of materials as well as ensuring that incentives are appropriately distributed throughout the entire supply chain.</p><p>Circular economy business models and improved knowledge thereof need to be developed and disseminated to enable entrepreneurs, industries, and business sectors to work together effectively and to make the transition towards the circular economy.

In addition, the underpinning economics leading to further development and future implementation of business models that facilitate the transition towards a circular economy, should be investigated together with the potential of these business models to achieve wider social sustainability benefits, including job creation potential, especially in SMEs. These activities should be based on the identification of drivers and barriers through existing initiatives, programmes, or concrete cases of already successfully applied circular economy business models or selected sectors which have high potential for a transition to the circular economy. All relevant actors and entire chains of production and use should be taken into account. The selected concrete cases or sectors should be sufficient in number to derive generic recommendations at EU level and relevant to support Europe's re-industrialisation, and the Commission\u2019s initiatives in the field of Industry 2020, Internet of Things, the Digital Single Market and Resource Efficiency. Recommendations should be provided in support of policy making, and for future implementation or replication of developed circular economy business models.</p><p>Smart, data-driven ICT environments that can contribute to enabling a new generation of business models that maximise performance and added value to the customer, could be also considered, for example sharing, leasing, remanufacturing and new forms of cooperative or social enterprises.</p><p>The project activities should aim to attract interest from public and private organisations; the engagement of policy and decision makers should be envisaged; the involvement of scientific actors and business- and higher economic education schools is encouraged in the selection and analysis of cases.

To make the best of this potential, it is essential that schools and educational institutions, as well as non-formal ways of learning, empower Europe\u2019s young innovators with the skills they need from early on in life. Empowering the young through skills for innovation and entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship, is particularly important to building more inclusive societies giving opportunities to all, including young innovators from less privileged backgrounds or those with disabilities in order to address inequalities.</p><p>The challenge to be addressed by this topic is to improve learning and teaching in innovation-related skills for young boys and girls at the age of primary and secondary education through the design and piloting of new innovative ways of skills education, including technologies, processes and relations.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>New approaches for educating skills need to be developed, piloted and scaled up. There is a lack of sufficient collaboration with entrepreneurial stakeholders in teaching and students practice, and a lack of inter-generational learning. Young people need to be supported with tools, resources and an open environment encouraging experimentation and the development of joint projects including based on interdisciplinary approaches. Effective supporting schemes should guide young people into their entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>Building upon existing initiatives in Europe, the consortia (which shall include entrepreneurial partners, and may include partners from civil society and the social economy) shall develop new approaches and innovative models for skills education targeted at young people.</p><p>The involvement of young people in the activities of the consortium (not just as recipients of the outputs) is essential. This may include new inter-active methods and new pedagogical modules that will be easily accessible and part of an open platform, which will aim to reach out to thousands of schools and learning sites across Europe. The innovative schemes and new modules will enable the young, future innovators, to develop new capabilities and experimentation attitudes and turn their ideas into successful entrepreneurial and social projects<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>Promising new models combining technologies with organisational change and building new participatory relations in learning processes - can be tested and adapted in different regions.

This will boost innovation and entrepreneurship capacity, bringing together many stakeholders including from education, traditional business, the social and service economy and volunteering schemes. It will thereby empower young innovators across Europe, provide for innovative business models and give them tools to engage in society and channel their energies to create opportunities for the future.

A challenge for co-creation in the public sector is organising the collaboration between the different actors, including between public administrations themselves, in order to share information, knowledge and resources. Co-creation across borders contributes to achieving an effective Single Market.</p><p>Co-creation and collaboration between administrations can improve their efficiency and effectiveness by opening up and sharing knowledge and resources with the aim to unlock productivity improvements and foster the creation of more public value. Public administrations and government agencies can re-use the data already in their possession on citizens and businesses, under the control and consent of citizens and businesses, by sharing it between themselves. This can allow them to provide administrative services in a pro-active manner. Administrative burden of citizens and businesses will be reduced, legal obligations will be fulfilled faster and citizen services will be simpler and less cumbersome.

The users, public administrations in the EU, will engage in the co-creation process, in order to collaboratively elaborate a common architecture. The project will enable the interaction and co-creation based on the existing national systems, and will re-use when relevant existing cross-border services, in particular services operated by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) telecom programme. To demonstrate the robustness and the benefit to businesses the project must pilot the system for at least 12 months in real conditions. The free access to the foreground must be guaranteed to enable access by any Member State to the results specifications. The project will also identify the drivers, barriers, potential vulnerabilities and legal issues (such as legal barriers or gaps) for the implementation of the once-only principle for businesses across borders in Europe. The ultimate aim is that businesses should supply information only once to any public administration in Europe. Public administration offices take action to share this data also cross-border, thereby contributing to making the Digital Single Market a reality. The specific administration processes for businesses for piloting purposes will be identified in the proposal, building from a number of use cases.</p><p>The large scale pilot (IA) shall include a minimum of six relevant national administrations (or legal entities designated to act on their behalf) in at least six different EU Member States or Associated Countries.</p><p>The Commission expects to finance only one project under this action.</p><p>b) Coordination and Support Action<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup></p><p>Proposals for a Coordination and Support Action will support networking, discussion, exchange of experience and planning for the implementation of the cross-border application of the once-only principle for citizens, taking into account data protection aspects and the control and consent of citizens.

Effective and reliable policies need to consider the available data (including its structure and topology) and evidence to ensure accurate and meaningful information. Big data offers many opportunities; using data analytics to generate new insights, increasing predictive power and identifying unexpected patterns and relationships that can help inform policy making. For instance data analytics tools can also help public authorities to better detect and evidence patterns of non-compliance in many policy areas affecting the health, the safety and the welfare of citizens in the internal market of goods, services and persons. Effective processing power and expertise are widely used in the retail and commercial sector, the challenge is to create effective resources to make this available to governments, allowing policy choices to become more evidence-based and analytical.</p><p>In addition, open policy-making and the integration of the citizens\u2019 perspective through the effective engagement of relevant social actors - for example over online platforms or by crowd-sourcing - can potentially generate vast amounts of data, which can allow policy options to become more informed. Furthermore, open policy-making can support a participatory, open and collaborative government vision. Besides simulations, perceptions data pose a further promising source of information. Conducted on a regular basis, e.g. by the Eurobarometer, identifying perceived bottlenecks in relation to policy reforms as well as assessing the perceived performance of past reforms becomes feasible; in some cases these official statistics may be complemented by new sources of data. Taken together, this may lead to developing second generation data tools and assessment for more targeted policy design. It also offers opportunities for different communities to take ownership of the use and analysis of data in an age where they are at risk of being alienated by too much information. In addition, policy implementation can significantly benefit from efficient enforcement and monitoring tools that are informed by data from various sources.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>In order to enable governments - at all levels - to benefit from the availability of relevant data and thereby introduce and implement effective policies, new or improved methods and tools are needed to support and establish new types of evidence-informed policy design and implementation and to facilitate the interpretation of big data for public communication, including new outcome-based. For public administrations to experiment with the possibilities offered by big data \u2013 for example through policy modelling, monitoring, enforcing, simulation, testing, analysis and policy compliance \u2013 there is a need to thoroughly understand the legal frameworks and to take into account sociological, cultural, political, legal and economic as well as behavioural aspects. Proposals should also elaborate on the relationship between evidence-based policy-making and citizens\u2019 participation, integrating the analysis of participatory elements.</p><p>a) Research and Innovation Actions</p><p>Proposals need to address several of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Methodological development for using big data in policy development, examining the extent to which policy-making structures and systems are ready to absorb and analyse big data;</li>  <li>Critical interdisciplinary assessment of the economic, political, epistemological, ethical and legal premises and implications of big data practices (including algorithmic governance, smart cities, etc.), allowing for the reflection on the potential benefits and risks;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for compilation, analysis and visualisation of data, including relevant open, official or certified data;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for mining, compilation, analysis and visualisation of data from any source, including data related to social dynamics and behaviour;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for data curation, meta-data schemes, data linking or for reconciliation of multiple data sets to render coherent narratives;</li>  <li>Understanding the implications of the increasing materiality of data with the development of the Internet of Things and its implications for the sustainability of government\u2019s effective use of big data for improved policy making in the longer term;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for opinion-mining of large data sets in order to avoid the situation that the bigger the data, the less clear how they have been produced;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for policy modelling and simulation to improve the predicative analysis capacity of governments;</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for iterative policy design and implementation (e.g. through the greater use of randomised controlled trials based on behavioural science);</li>  <li>Develop scalable and transferable methods and re-usable tools for policy enforcement and compliance monitoring tools.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should apply their methodology to policy areas addressing societal challenges (e.g. environment, migration, radicalisation, inequalities, unemployment, internal market obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods and services). When using open and big data in order to enlarge the evidence base for effective policy-making, principles such as independence, quality, coherence and consistency, confidentiality, impartiality and objectivity as well as representativeness and extrapolation to meaningful populations need to be considered. Data protection, ethical and privacy issues will also have to be addressed as well as ethical issues around storage, use and re-use of data. Application and improvement of existing quantitative tools is preferable. Sociological as well as behavioural science approaches are encouraged, especially where they aim to develop a deeper understanding of how public policy and services interact with citizens. If relevant, proposals also need to analyse the suitability of the proposed software.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>b) Coordination and Support Action<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>The activities should aim at encouraging networking of relevant stakeholders and teams working in the area of data-driven policy-making and policy-modelling and to support constituency building. Following an assessment of the needs of public administrations, the multidisciplinary network will identify methods, tools, technologies and applications for their implementation in the public sector, taking into consideration activities also undertaken outside the European Union and considering specificities relevant to different policy domains of public activity.

The changing characteristics of economies and societies in Europe require inclusion of multiple dimensions, including gender and age, new measurement and data for developing new policy for economic growth and well-being.</p><p>European growth prospects, job creation and well-being of citizens largely depend on economically successful innovations which address global and EU challenges and create new opportunities for firms. However, the importance of capital stock developments and investments, as well as labour skills, at a detailed industry level and for all types of tangible and intangible assets has not been fully integrated into the analysis of EU innovation and growth performances mainly due to data issues. Better measurement of tangible and intangible investments together with labour skills, in existing categories as well as inclusion of potentially relevant asset categories outside the current asset boundary (such as economic competences, organisational capital, co-creation, skills, marketing assets, firm specific human capital investments, culture and arts) \u2013 by taking gender and age into account - would improve the understanding about growth in knowledge-based, globalised and connected economies. Moreover, innovation driven growth strategies require a better understanding on the roles of services (including business services) and the use of ICT and internet at industry level. Equally vital for new growth strategies is a better understanding of the complementarities of firms' investments in global value added chains and the creation of new dynamic market industries.</p><p>Europe needs to understand and analyse the changing frame of references for the evaluation of the state and development of societies. Official statistics need to be modernised to provide a more complete picture through the incorporation of new metrics, based on new sources and data collection methods, in coherent frameworks delivering consistent evidences and narratives to policymakers. New sources (including social media) offer unparalleled opportunities to elicit information on welfare, wellbeing and societal progress by other means than traditional sample surveys and require the development of modern, innovative methods for official statistics. With all strata of the population being in scope, methodologically sound official statistics ensure that for e.g. a \u201csilent majority\u201d (those who do not tweet) or marginalised minorities (those who for e.g., lack bank accounts and credit cards and hence leave no trace in certain electronic systems) remain visible to policymakers when innovative, non-traditional sources are used to measure progress. The protection of individual data is furthermore a concern that should be taken into account.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>a) Research and innovation actions</p><p>Research aims to improve the availability and quality in the data on tangible and intangible investments, capital stock and the composition of labour inputs at industry level and/or firm level which in longer perspective qualifies for the endorsement from official statistics.</p><p>Compilation of data on tangible and intangible investment categories within the existing asset boundary of the national accounts standards (SNA 2008/ESA 2010) need to be targeted and supplemented with national sources and other types of calculations. Creating new data for potentially relevant asset categories outside the current asset boundary at a detailed industry level need statistical work together with implementing strategies and novel approaches to minimise cost and burden of compiling. Piloting and proof of concepts can be useful. All efforts to improve data availability and quality need to be consistent with the current statistical classification of economic activities (NACE Rev.2), National Accounts concepts, methodologies and quality criteria. It is important to use internationally harmonized official source statistics. Future extensions of official statistics can benefit from the already existing work on tangible and intangible capital stocks and labour input outside the official statistical systems by improving their quality in line with statistical quality criteria. It is essential to work out a strategy in which the statistical community cooperates with the economic and other social sciences communities to integrate the improved and/or newly created data into established official statistics to guarantee their lasting reproducibility.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>b) Coordination and Support Action<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>The coordination and support action should focus on the incorporation and alignment of new, possibly unofficial and unstructured, sources with established official statistics. It should build on the rich body of results in the alternative growth approaches, social, environmental and sustainable indicators, new consumption models and \u201cBeyond GDP\u201d domain \u2013 in consistency with National Accounts - covering both novel domains and non-traditional sources as well as innovative data collection approaches. It should incorporate a strong statistical methodological component focusing on obtaining consistency, representativity/social inclusion (in particular when innovative data collection methods are used) and measures of uncertainty. Piloting and proof of concept should be at the forefront. Disaggregation of statistics - geographically, or by other domains (e.g. identifying vulnerable population groups) - to provide greater insights and providing evidence allowing more focused policy decisions should be covered, as should metadata and other aspects of quality of statistics. At the same time data protection concerns should be addressed.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Better data and official statistics should improve our understanding about the changing nature of overall investment and growth dynamism in Europe. Widening of the concept of investment should bring insights for the European growth strategy and reveal cross-country differences in growth and productivity performances taking into account the role of tangible and intangible capital in the modernisation and competitiveness of EU industries and services. Moreover, through the investigation of the practical applicability of new sources, frameworks and methods for official statistics across a wide range of aspects regarding social and sustainable progress will provide a coherent framework of reliable evidence to the benefit of society.

This requires clear strategies for investing in R&amp;I coupled with quality R&amp;I programmes and strong institutions capable of implementing these programmes in close connection with the business sector and other stakeholders such as civil society. In addition, there is a clear need to improve the overall framework conditions for transforming R&amp;I investments into tangible results, whether as new products or services or in terms of less tangible impacts such as improvements in the quality of life or inclusion.</p><p>The challenge for policy makers is to design policies and programmes with targeted funding to address well identified bottlenecks and which are adapted to the specific context of the research and innovation system in question. This is key to improving the efficiency of the European research and innovation system as a whole, as was stressed by the Commission in its Communication on 'Research and innovation as sources of renewed growth'. <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>Designing such policies and programmes requires a sound evidence base around the performance of research and innovation systems, the impact of research and innovation policies, the impact of research and innovation on economic growth, job creation and societal progress, and on the way in which public funding and policies can influence performance and impact. The Commission regularly publishes authoritative reports (e.g. the Innovation Union Scoreboard and the Innovation Union Competitiveness Report) which contribute to this evidence base, but given the increasing importance of research and innovation and recent evolutions in this field, the analysis regarding these issues needs to become more sophisticated.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research will focus on establishing new methodologies for assessing the performance and impact of research and innovation and the ways in which public policies and funding can influence these. This should focus in particular on the following aspects:</p><p>(2016) Integration of research and innovation in macro-economic models: fiscal policies are often supported by macro-economic models to make an ex-ante assessment of the impact of budgetary measures and structural reforms. This includes dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, macro-sectoral models and econometric modelling. A common shortcoming of these macro-economic models is that they typically do not account for the long-term benefits of public research and innovation investments and policies, fail to take full account of the quality of these investments, or do so only in a limited manner. Projects should focus on developing modelling approaches which go beyond the current state-of-the-art by incorporating for instance: the distinction between public and private research sectors and the different ways in which public funding and policies can incentivise increased activity and quality in these sectors; the fact that quality of research and innovation is not homogenous (including at sectoral level) or the influence public policies can have on the quantity and quality of the stock of highly skilled people, on the link between human capital and the production and use of knowledge, on the productivity of knowledge production or on spill-over and technology diffusion mechanisms;</p><p>(2016) Improving the parameterisation of the aforementioned models: in addition to developing novel modelling approaches, further work is also needed on empirically determining the underlying parameters (elasticity factors) used in the aforementioned models and which link for instance the human capital stock to knowledge production, the production, diffusion and use of knowledge to innovation or which quantify the effect public policies have on these parameters;</p><p>(2017) New indicators for assessing research and innovation performance: projects should focus on developing and applying new indicators for assessing the performance of distinct elements of the research and innovation system, including the impact of research and innovation policies. These should go beyond the typical bibliometric and patenting indicators, as these only offer a limited view, in particular in an evolving landscape in which for instance open access mechanisms, social media, social innovation people mobility assume an increasing role. Such new indicators should allow policy makers to assess in a broader and more comprehensive way evolutions in performance and how these are linked to policy reforms;</p><p>(2017) Determining the societal impact of research and innovation funding: policy makers need to justify research and innovation spending by demonstrating the impact it has in terms of broader societal benefits. Projects should develop and test new ways to assess the societal impact of public funding allocated to research and innovation, for instance by building on examples of quantitative approaches (such as the USA's Star Metrics initiative or the European SIMPATIC project) or could develop qualitative approaches . Projects should take a broad approach and go beyond evaluating impacts in terms of productivity growth, economic growth and job creation, by also assessing the impact of public funding on tackling major societal challenges such as those defined in Horizon 2020.</p><p>Projects to be funded on the 2016 budget should address either the first or second issue described above or can combine them in one project. Projects to be funded on the 2017 budget should address either the third or fourth issue described above or can combine them in one project.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

        "desc": "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Challenge</SPAN>:<p>The growing attention given to research and innovation over the past decades has resulted in increased amounts of public funding being channelled to research and innovation, but also to a variety of policies and funding programmes being put in place in Europe, in order to maximise the quality and impact of this funding.</p><p>These policies have been wide in scope, ranging from basic research all the way up to supporting the market introduction of innovation and used a variety of instruments, oriented not only towards the production of knowledge and innovation, but also towards optimising the processes by which innovations are generated (including Co-Creation).</p><p>Investments in R&amp;I must be smart and efficient and obtain the most value for every euro invested. This requires clear strategies for investing in R&amp;I coupled with quality R&amp;I programmes and strong institutions capable of implementing these programmes in close connection with the business sector and other stakeholders such as civil society. In addition, there is a clear need to improve the overall framework conditions for transforming R&amp;I investments into tangible results, whether as new products or services or in terms of less tangible impacts such as improvements in the quality of life or inclusion.</p><p>The challenge for policy makers is to design policies and programmes with targeted funding to address well identified bottlenecks and which are adapted to the specific context of the research and innovation system in question. This is key to improving the efficiency of the European research and innovation system as a whole, as was stressed by the Commission in its Communication on 'Research and innovation as sources of renewed growth'. <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>Designing such policies and programmes requires a sound evidence base around the performance of research and innovation systems, the impact of research and innovation policies, the impact of research and innovation on economic growth, job creation and societal progress, and on the way in which public funding and policies can influence performance and impact. The Commission regularly publishes authoritative reports (e.g. the Innovation Union Scoreboard and the Innovation Union Competitiveness Report) which contribute to this evidence base, but given the increasing importance of research and innovation and recent evolutions in this field, the analysis regarding these issues needs to become more sophisticated.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research will focus on establishing new methodologies for assessing the performance and impact of research and innovation and the ways in which public policies and funding can influence these. This should focus in particular on the following aspects:</p><p>(2016) Integration of research and innovation in macro-economic models: fiscal policies are often supported by macro-economic models to make an ex-ante assessment of the impact of budgetary measures and structural reforms. This includes dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, macro-sectoral models and econometric modelling. A common shortcoming of these macro-economic models is that they typically do not account for the long-term benefits of public research and innovation investments and policies, fail to take full account of the quality of these investments, or do so only in a limited manner. Projects should focus on developing modelling approaches which go beyond the current state-of-the-art by incorporating for instance: the distinction between public and private research sectors and the different ways in which public funding and policies can incentivise increased activity and quality in these sectors; the fact that quality of research and innovation is not homogenous (including at sectoral level) or the influence public policies can have on the quantity and quality of the stock of highly skilled people, on the link between human capital and the production and use of knowledge, on the productivity of knowledge production or on spill-over and technology diffusion mechanisms;</p><p>(2016) Improving the parameterisation of the aforementioned models: in addition to developing novel modelling approaches, further work is also needed on empirically determining the underlying parameters (elasticity factors) used in the aforementioned models and which link for instance the human capital stock to knowledge production, the production, diffusion and use of knowledge to innovation or which quantify the effect public policies have on these parameters;</p><p>(2017) New indicators for assessing research and innovation performance: projects should focus on developing and applying new indicators for assessing the performance of distinct elements of the research and innovation system, including the impact of research and innovation policies. These should go beyond the typical bibliometric and patenting indicators, as these only offer a limited view, in particular in an evolving landscape in which for instance open access mechanisms, social media, social innovation people mobility assume an increasing role. Such new indicators should allow policy makers to assess in a broader and more comprehensive way evolutions in performance and how these are linked to policy reforms;</p><p>(2017) Determining the societal impact of research and innovation funding: policy makers need to justify research and innovation spending by demonstrating the impact it has in terms of broader societal benefits. Projects should develop and test new ways to assess the societal impact of public funding allocated to research and innovation, for instance by building on examples of quantitative approaches (such as the USA's Star Metrics initiative or the European SIMPATIC project) or could develop qualitative approaches . Projects should take a broad approach and go beyond evaluating impacts in terms of productivity growth, economic growth and job creation, by also assessing the impact of public funding on tackling major societal challenges such as those defined in Horizon 2020.</p><p>Projects to be funded on the 2016 budget should address either the first or second issue described above or can combine them in one project. Projects to be funded on the 2017 budget should address either the third or fourth issue described above or can combine them in one project.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Depending on the aspect addressed, and in line with the scope above, projects are expected to respectively deliver the following impact: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>The development of models which provide a realistic assessment of the variety of ways in which research and innovation activities transmit into outputs and impact and of the ways in which public funding and policies can influence this transmission; </li>  <li>An empirical determination of realistic values for the underlying parameters used in the models; </li>  <li>A monitoring of research and innovation performance which captures the broader spectrum of ways in which research and innovation activities translate into outputs and impact, in which knowledge circulates between public and private sectors and internationally or through which quality of research and innovation can be assessed; </li>  <li>A reliable assessment of the societal benefits generated by public funding for research and innovation, not only in terms of productivity growth, economic growth and job creation, but also the impact it has on tackling major societal challenges.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/open_innovation.html#c,topics=flags/s/OpenInnovation/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Open Innovation</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/ssh.html#c,topics=flags/s/SSH/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/open_science.html#c,topics=flags/s/OpenScience/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Open Science</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>COM(2014) 339 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Research and innovation as sources of renewed growth.</p>"

        "desc": "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Challenge</SPAN>:<p>Research and innovation dynamics are increasingly being influenced by the development of interactions among all stakeholders (\"quadruple helix\" approach). More actors are involved in knowledge creation and the innovation process. Universities and research institutions collaborate with business enterprises, hospitals, local municipalities, administrations for public services and citizen organisations. At the same time, the research and innovation process is changing with the transition towards open science and open innovation. The focus is increasingly on developing, testing and rolling out solutions to societal challenges for the benefit of citizens and local jobs. Since 2014, the EU has boosted its support to this dynamics through new funding instruments and modalities, incl. smart specialisation strategies. This show the way for new hot-spots of knowledge production and co-creation in Europe.</p><p>However, information and data on this new research and innovation dynamics is relatively unknown and fragmented. Local and regional actors are often not aware of which relevant and complementary knowledge, and possible project partners, can be found in other places in Europe. And national and European policy makers do not have the overview of hot spots in Europe. This information would enable them to refine their policies and funding instruments, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of national and European knowledge systems.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The aim of a European map of knowledge co-creation is to create a methodology and web-based platform that presents data on institutional, regional and national knowledge co-creation hot-spots. The resulting maps will enable web-based search for co-creation and knowledge production hot spots addressing societal challenges or Key Enabling Technologies. The methodology will make use of state of the art of all available data sets (e.g. webometrics, bibliometrics, patent data, EU-funded collaboration, institutional data) and methods for linking them, ensuring synergies and avoiding overlaps, also taking into account social sciences and humanities and big data. It will also be flexible enough to connect to existing and complementary data systems with more traditional input and output indicators on Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and Public Research Organizations.</p><p>The funding will enable methodological developments and a European-wide pilot mapping of knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation. As a first stage, all institutions actively involved in knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation in Europe will be identified. In parallel, a common terminology will be established corresponding to specific societal challenges or technologies. The platform should have an interactive graphic interface to allow users to quickly parameter their request and obtain European maps of knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation in a specific societal challenge or technology at regional and local level.</p><p>The platform shall be fully compliant with all existing definitional standards in the field of S&amp;T and be inter-operable and scalable, from an IT point of view.</p><p>The Union shall support the initial development of the Map. The Union therefore asks proposers to suggest a convincing, sustainable, commercially viable business model for the operation and further development of the Map in the absence of follow-up support from the Union.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in order of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The proposed Map of knowledge co-creation shall provide a more effective basis for evidence-based policy making in the EU, through giving a novel insight to the driving forces bringing about knowledge production, co-creation and cooperation for societal challenges or key enabling technologies. It will also allow actors at local and regional level to identify possible partners and peers in other countries in Europe. The map crosses over disciplines and territories and go beyond the current state of the art to identify and assess the complete range of parameters linked to measuring actors, and hot-spots addressing different challenges. It fully capitalise on recent developments in the availability of data and in computational techniques. In such a way, it shall enrich the knowledge base upon which research investment decisions are taken and harness the full power of data visualisation tools by way of collecting large datasets and presenting them in a clear and understandable way, thus allowing essential policy insights quickly, in a flexible manner, and at a reasonable cost.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/ssh.html#c,topics=flags/s/SSH/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/open_science.html#c,topics=flags/s/OpenScience/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">Open Science</a><br></p>\n"

With the increasing international competition in space science Europe should continue to play a leading role in planetary science shaping the research in the field including the elaboration of planetary protection guidelines.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with space powers active in planetary science. The diverse range of competences spread among universities, research institutes, and space agencies in different countries in the world, should be harnessed in this proposal in view of establishing a coordinated authoritative position in the planetary protection research field. Networking, experts meetings and workshops resulting in recommendations for further action and guidelines for future missions are part of the effort.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR\u00a01 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. </p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> This activity would allow reviewing the planetary protection status of outer Solar System bodies including small Solar System bodies. That may include to establish a new categorisation and the measures that should be taken (or not) to protect them from Earth-sourced biological and organic contamination. Addressing the categorisations of future missions to the outer Solar System and making recommendations will help improving the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Planetary Protection Policy and help to resolve scientific uncertainties associated with current knowledge. This action should provide the basis for a regular exchange of information on the issue of planetary protection and identify also opportunities for European scientists to participate in future international missions. </p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Coordination and support action </p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/ftags/international_cooperation.html#c,topics=flags/s/IntlCoop/1/1&+callStatus/asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n"
